Perfect 👍 Let’s unpack that “core rule”:

---

## 🔹 DOM as a Tree

The DOM (Document Object Model) represents your HTML page as a **tree of nodes**.

* Each **element** (`<div>`, `<p>`, etc.) and each **piece of text** is a node.
* A node can only have **one parent** at a time.

So in the tree structure:

* One node = one position.
* If you try to append the same node somewhere else, the DOM doesn’t duplicate it — it **removes it from the old place and moves it to the new place**.

---

## 🔹 Example 1: One text node reused

```js
let text = document.createTextNode("Hello");

let div1 = document.createElement("div");
let div2 = document.createElement("div");

div1.appendChild(text);
div2.appendChild(text);
```

Result in DOM:

```html
<div></div>
<div>Hello</div>
```

👉 `Hello` ended up **only in `div2`**, because the same text node got *moved*.

---

## 🔹 Example 2: Element reuse

```js
let p = document.createElement("p");
p.innerText = "Hi";

document.body.appendChild(p);
document.querySelector("#container").appendChild(p);
```

Result:

* `<p>` appears **only inside `#container`**.
* It was **removed from `body`** when you appended it to `#container`.

---

## 🔹 Why does this happen?

Because in a **tree data structure**:

* A node cannot belong to two parents.
* If it could, the structure would no longer be a tree but a graph with multiple references.
* The DOM enforces **tree consistency**.

---

## 🔹 How to actually duplicate a node?

If you want it in multiple places:

* Create a **new node each time**:

  ```js
  div1.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Hello"));
  div2.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Hello"));
  ```
* Or **clone** the existing node:

  ```js
  div2.appendChild(text.cloneNode(true));
  ```

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**
A DOM node = one unique object in memory = one place in the DOM tree at a time.
Appending it again doesn’t copy, it **moves** it.

Would you like me to also draw you a **tree diagram illustration** (text-based) of how the node moves between parents? That makes it super clear.
