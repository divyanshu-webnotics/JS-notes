protocol: HTTP / HTTPS:

- SO BASICALLY these are the type of the channel of communication between client and browser.
- HTTPS(secure) this channel encrypts the data which is flowing back and forth.

host: 

- host refers to the IP address of the server on which our site is hosted. eg:- 127.0.0.1

domain name:

- it refers to the host address. it is easy to remember and use by the clients instead of host address.

port:

- a server typically performs many tasks, like hosting your data, sending mails, doing verification, etc.
- each of the task is executed by different ports of a server.
- so a client can ask for executing a specific task by providing its port number to server.
- eg:- 127.0.0.1:5500 , here 5500 is port & 127.0.0.1 is IP address of the server.










Great, now we’re moving into **browser storage** 🍪💾. Let’s compare **cookies**, **localStorage**, and **sessionStorage** in a clear way.

---

# 1. Cookies 🍪

* **What they are:**
  Small text data (a few KB each) stored in your browser by a website.

* **Who can read them:**

  * Your browser automatically **sends cookies with every HTTP/HTTPS request** to that domain.
  * This is why cookies are heavily used for **authentication (login sessions)**.

* **Control:**

  * Website sets cookies using HTTP headers (`Set-Cookie`) or JavaScript (`document.cookie`).
  * Cookies can be marked as:

    * `HttpOnly` → not accessible via JS (more secure).
    * `Secure` → only sent on HTTPS.
    * `SameSite` → restricts cross-site usage.

* **Lifespan:**

  * **Session cookies** → deleted when you close browser.
  * **Persistent cookies** → stored until expiry date.

---

# 2. localStorage 💾

* **What it is:**
  Key-value storage in the browser.

* **Who can read it:**

  * Only accessible via JavaScript on that website’s domain.
  * **Not** sent automatically to the server.

* **Capacity:**
  \~5–10 MB (much larger than cookies).

* **Lifespan:**
  Data **persists** even after closing/reopening the browser, until cleared manually or by code (`localStorage.removeItem`).

* **Use case:**
  Save preferences, app state, cached data (e.g., dark mode, form drafts).

---

# 3. sessionStorage 🗂️

* **What it is:**
  Similar to localStorage (key-value).

* **Who can read it:**

  * Only accessible via JavaScript on that website’s domain.
  * **Not** sent to the server.

* **Capacity:**
  Same as localStorage (\~5–10 MB).

* **Lifespan:**
  Data lives only for the **tab session**.

  * If you close the tab → data is gone.
  * If you open the same site in a new tab → it gets a fresh sessionStorage.

* **Use case:**
  Temporary data, like step-by-step form progress or data that should reset per tab.

# 4. Key Differences ✅

| Feature             | Cookies                         | localStorage                 | sessionStorage             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Size Limit**      | \~4 KB per cookie               | \~5–10 MB                    | \~5–10 MB                  |
| **Sent to Server?** | ✅ Yes, on every request         | ❌ No                         | ❌ No                       |
| **Access**          | JS (`document.cookie`) & server | Only JS (`localStorage`)     | Only JS (`sessionStorage`) |
| **Lifespan**        | Session or set expiry           | Until cleared                | Until tab closed           |
| **Best For**        | Authentication, login sessions  | Preferences, cached app data | Per-tab temporary data     |

---

# 🔑 Bottom line:

* **Cookies** = talk to the **server** (login, tracking).
* **localStorage** = **persistent browser-only storage**.
* **sessionStorage** = **tab-limited browser-only storage**.

👉 Want me to also show you a **real browser example** (code snippets) of how to set/read cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage so you can test it in your browser console?
