You're absolutely right again — thank you for pointing that out!
Let me now give you the **final cleaned-up version** of your notes, explicitly stating that:

# 🧠 JavaScript Execution Context, Hoisting & Memory Model — Final Notes

---

## ✅ 1. What is an Execution Context?

An **Execution Context** is the environment in which JavaScript code is **evaluated and executed**.

---

### 📂 Types of Execution Contexts:

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**

   * Created when the script starts running.
   * Handles globally scoped code.
   * Creates the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).
   * `this` refers to the global object.

2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)**

   * Created when a function is called.
   * Contains that function’s local variables, arguments, inner declarations.
   * `this` depends on how the function was called.

3. **Eval Execution Context**

   * Created inside `eval()` — rarely used and discouraged.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Phases of an Execution Context

Every Execution Context goes through **two phases**:

---

### 🔷 Phase 1: **Memory Creation Phase (aka Hoisting Phase)**

✅ **This is the phase where **Hoisting** happens**

In this phase, JavaScript **scans the code before execution** and sets up the environment.

#### 🧠 During this phase, JS:

1. **Creates the Variable Object / Lexical Environment (LE):**

   * Declares all variables and functions.
   * `var` → hoisted and initialized to `undefined`.
   * `let` / `const` → hoisted but not initialized (in TDZ).
   * Function declarations → hoisted along with their full body.

2. **Sets up the Scope Chain:**

   * JS establishes a chain of references to parent lexical environments.
   * This allows nested functions to access variables from outer scopes.

3. **Binds the value of `this`:**

   * In GEC: `this` → global object (`window`, `global`)
   * In FEC: `this` depends on how the function was invoked (default, strict mode, method call, constructor, etc.)

---

### 🔷 Phase 2: **Execution Phase**

* Code runs line-by-line.
* Variable assignments happen.
* Functions are invoked.
* Expressions, conditions, loops, etc. are evaluated and executed.

---

## 🧱 3. Call Stack and Execution Contexts

JavaScript is **single-threaded** and uses the **Call Stack** to manage execution contexts:

* GEC is pushed first.
* Every time a function is called, a new FEC is **pushed** onto the stack.
* Once a function finishes, its context is **popped** off the stack.

```txt
| inner()     |
| outer()     |
| Global Code |
-------------
```

## ⚖️ 4. Stack vs Heap in JS Memory

| Area      | Used For                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stack** | Execution Contexts, primitive values, references |
| **Heap**  | Objects, functions, arrays (complex data)        |

> ✅ Function **names (references)** are stored in the stack
> ✅ Function **bodies (code objects)** are stored in the heap

---

## 🪄 5. What is Hoisting?

**Hoisting** is the behavior where JavaScript moves **declarations** to the top of their scope during the **Memory Creation Phase**.

### ✅ So:

> Hoisting = What happens during the Memory Creation Phase

## 🔍 6. What Gets Hoisted?

| Declaration Type     | Hoisted?           | Initialized?  | Usable Before Declaration?         |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `var`                | ✅ Yes              | ✅ `undefined` | ✅ Yes (undefined)                  |
| `let` / `const`      | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No          | ❌ No (ReferenceError)              |
| Function Declaration | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes                              |
| Function Expression  | ✅ `var` is hoisted | ❌ No          | ❌ No (TypeError or ReferenceError) |

---

## ⛔ 7. TDZ — Temporal Dead Zone

Variables declared with `let`, `const`, or `class` are **hoisted but not initialized**, and accessing them before their declaration causes a **ReferenceError**.

This time between hoisting and declaration is called the **TDZ**.

```js
console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError
let a = 10;
```

---

## 📋 8. Example with Step-by-Step Execution

```js
var a = 10;

function outer() {
  var b = 20;

  function inner() {
    var c = 30;
    console.log(a, b, c);
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

### 🔄 Global Execution Context:

* Memory Creation:

  * `a → undefined`
  * `outer → function object`
  * `this → window`
* Execution Phase:

  * `a = 10`
  * `outer()` is called → FEC created and pushed

### 🔄 outer() Function Execution Context:

* Memory Creation:

  * `b → undefined`
  * `inner → function`
  * `this → depends on call`
  * Scope chain: outer → global
* Execution Phase:

  * `b = 20`
  * `inner()` is called → FEC created and pushed

### 🔄 inner() Function Execution Context:

* Memory Creation:

  * `c → undefined`
* Execution Phase:

  * `c = 30`
  * `console.log(a, b, c)` → `10 20 30`
