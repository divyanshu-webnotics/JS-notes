Fantastic question — this gets to the core difference between having own properties vs. being mutable.
You're asking:
“If the string object (new String("abc")) has 0, 1, 2 as own properties, then why can’t I mutate them like strObj[1] = 'x'?”
⚠️ The key is:
Even though index properties (like "0", "1", etc.) exist as own properties on new String() objects, they are:
👉 Non-writable
Meaning you cannot change them, even though they appear as part of the object.
🔍 Proof:
const strObj = new String("abc");

console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(strObj, "1"));
🧾 Output:
{
  value: "b",
  writable: false,
  enumerable: true,
  configurable: false
}
⬅️ See that? writable: false means:
You cannot do strObj[1] = 'x'
The value 'b' stays frozen
✅ So, even though:
new String("abc") creates an object with:
{
  0: 'a',
  1: 'b',
  2: 'c',
  length: 3
}
Each of those keys ("0", "1", etc.) is:
an own property
but it is non-writable and non-configurable
🔒 Why did JavaScript designers do this?
To preserve immutability of strings, even when used as objects.
JavaScript strings — whether primitive or object-wrapped — are always immutable in content.
String objects (new String(...)) give you an object wrapper,
But that object is still frozen in terms of its character content.
🔄 But you can still add properties!
strObj.newProp = "hello";
console.log(strObj.newProp); // ✅ Works

strObj[1] = "Z";
console.log(strObj[1]); // Still "b" ❌ change ignored
You can add new props, but can't modify existing character indices.
✅ Summary
Property
Value
strObj.hasOwnProperty('1')
✅ true
Is strObj[1] mutable?
❌ false — writable: false
Can I add new props?
✅ strObj.foo = "bar" works
Why?
To preserve string immutability, even in objects
Let me know if you'd like to run some hands-on mutation tests!











Great follow-up!
JavaScript doesn’t use private or Object.freeze() to make string characters immutable. Instead, it uses internal definitions and property descriptors when creating String objects.
🛠️ So how does JavaScript make string characters non-writable?
When you do this:
const strObj = new String("abc");
JavaScript automatically adds properties like "0", "1", "2" using:
Object.defineProperty(strObj, "0", {
  value: "a",
  writable: false,
  enumerable: true,
  configurable: false
});
➡️ This is how you make a property non-writable manually.
So internally, the JavaScript engine uses this technique for each character in the string:
🔍 Internal logic (conceptually):
for (let i = 0; i < stringData.length; i++) {
  Object.defineProperty(strObj, String(i), {
    value: stringData[i],
    writable: false,          // ❌ can't modify
    enumerable: true,         // shows in for...in or Object.keys
    configurable: false       // ❌ can't delete or redefine
  });
}
💡 Why not use Object.freeze()?
Object.freeze() makes the entire object immutable.
But JavaScript only wants the character indexes to be immutable, not the whole object.
So instead of freezing everything, it only marks the index properties as non-writable.
That’s why you can still do:
strObj.custom = "hello"; // ✅ allowed
But you can't do:
strObj[1] = "z"; // ❌ ignored
🔐 What about private?
JavaScript didn't use private class fields here.
These are low-level built-in behaviors of the language.
No #private fields or classes involved.
Just strict control via Object.defineProperty.
✅ Summary
Feature
Explanation
Character immutability
Achieved via Object.defineProperty
writable: false
Prevents you from changing characters
configurable: false
Prevents you from deleting/redfining props
Not using Object.freeze()
Because we only want char indexes to be frozen
Not using private
Because it’s handled internally by the engine
Would you like to see a demo where we define our own non-writable property like a string does?


NOTE:::
SAME IS THE CASE FOR TEMPORARY OBJECTS IN STRING LITERAL, THAT WHY ARE THEY IMMUTABLE, REASON IS SAME , their writable property is set as false, so js engine silently ignores the assignment statement without throwing error.
