let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(arr);

// Here, the num is a copy of the arr elements therefore changing it wont cause any effect on original array elements because simple numbers/strings are always passed by value.

arr.forEach((num, index, arr) => {
    // num += 1;
    arr[index] += 1;
})

console.log(arr);

// Here , we are directly changing the index of the arr array as its passed as argument in callBack , and as arrays are always passed by reference therefore, it cause the effects to be visible on the original array.
