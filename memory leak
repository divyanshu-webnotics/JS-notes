# 📘 Detailed Notes: Memory Leak vs Dangling Pointer

---

## 🧠 What Is a Memory Leak?

### 📖 Definition:

A **memory leak** occurs when:

* You dynamically allocate memory (e.g., using `new` in C++).
* But **you forget to free it** (using `delete`).
* And/or you **lose the reference to it**, so you **can’t access or free it anymore**.

➡️ The memory remains **allocated in the heap** but becomes **unreachable** — this is called a **leak**.

---

### 🔥 Real-world Analogy:

> Imagine booking a hotel room 🏨 (memory allocated),
> but throwing the key in a river 🌊 (reference lost).
> The room is still reserved, but no one can access it.
> That’s a memory leak.

---

### 🧪 Technical Explanation:

* Heap memory is manually managed in C/C++.
* If memory is allocated with `new`, and we don’t call `delete`, it remains allocated.
* Over time, multiple leaks → increasing memory usage → eventually system runs out of memory (OOM).

---

### ✅ Code Example 1: Reassigning pointer without freeing previous memory

```cpp
int* p = new int(5);   // Step 1: memory allocated
p = new int(10);       // Step 2: p now points to new memory
// ❌ Step 3: First allocation (int(5)) is lost — leaked
delete p;              // deletes only the second allocation
```

* The first block (`int(5)`) is **leaked**.
* No pointer refers to it anymore — it’s stuck in the heap.

---

### ✅ Code Example 2: Losing reference by setting to `nullptr`

```cpp
int* p = new int(42);  // Memory allocated
p = nullptr;           // ❌ Lost reference without calling delete
```

* Memory is still allocated, but you can’t access it.
* You can’t even free it now — **leaked forever**.

---

### ✅ Code Example 3: Pointer goes out of scope

```cpp
void createLeak() {
    int* temp = new int(100);
    // ❌ Function ends without deleting memory
}
// temp is destroyed, but heap memory remains
```

* When `temp` goes out of scope, the pointer is destroyed.
* But memory remains in heap — another **leak**.

---

### 🔍 Why Is It Dangerous?

* Memory that is no longer used **still consumes space**.
* Leads to **increased memory usage** over time.
* Eventually can **crash the program** due to exhaustion of RAM.

---

## 🧠 What Is a Dangling Pointer?

### 📖 Definition:

A **dangling pointer** is a pointer that **still holds the address** of memory that has **already been freed**.

➡️ Using it causes **undefined behavior** — you might read garbage, corrupt data, or crash the program.

---

### 🔥 Real-world Analogy:

> Imagine sitting on a chair 🪑, then setting it on fire 🔥 (freeing memory),
> and then trying to sit again 😵 — you’ll fall (crash).
> That’s a dangling pointer.

---

### 🧪 Technical Explanation:

* A pointer remains valid in C++ even after `delete`.
* It still holds the old address unless explicitly set to `nullptr`.
* Any access or double delete → **segmentation fault**, **data corruption**, or **crash**.

---

### ✅ Code Example 1: Access after delete

```cpp
int* p = new int(10);
delete p;

*p = 20;  // ❌ Accessing freed memory — dangerous
```

* `p` points to memory that no longer belongs to your program.

---

### ✅ Code Example 2: Double delete

```cpp
int* p1 = new int(30);
int* p2 = p1;

delete p1;  // memory freed
delete p2;  // ❌ double delete — undefined behavior
```

* Since both `p1` and `p2` point to the same memory, deleting it twice is fatal.

---

### ✅ Code Example 3: Return of local address

```cpp
int* giveAddress() {
    int x = 5;
    return &x;  // ❌ x is on stack, gets destroyed after function returns
}

int* ptr = giveAddress();
cout << *ptr;  // ❌ Dangling: pointer to destroyed stack memory
```

---

### 🔍 Why Is It Dangerous?

* You might write into memory that belongs to:

  * Another object
  * The OS
  * Or memory that is unallocated
* Results in:

  * **Segmentation fault**
  * **Data loss**
  * **Security vulnerabilities**
  * **Hard-to-find bugs**

## 🧹 How to Prevent Memory Leaks and Dangling Pointers

### ✅ In C/C++

| Problem          | Solution                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory Leak      | Always `delete` what you `new`                                            |
| Dangling Pointer | Set pointer to `nullptr` after `delete`                                   |
| Both             | Use `smart pointers` in modern C++ (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) |

| Java       | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No         | Possible, but rare                            | ❌ No                        |
| C++        | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes                                         | ✅ Yes                       |
