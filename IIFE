(function print(){
   var a = 99;
   var b = 1;

   console.log(a+b);
   
   
})()

// console.log(a+b);

i read about iife, and what its basic purpose wass that , it helps to minimise the pollution of global scope, like in this example , we had to do this operation of declaring 2 variables and doing operation on them, and it doesnt pollutes the global scope.


also this could have been achieved by simply using the let keyword for declaring a and b
