Absolutely! Here's a clean and concise **notes-style explanation** of **dynamic memory allocation in JavaScript**:

## üìí Notes: Dynamic Memory Allocation in JavaScript

### üîπ What is Dynamic Memory Allocation?

> Memory that is **allocated during program execution (runtime)**, not in advance (at compile time).

---

### üîπ Memory in JavaScript

| Memory Type | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stack**   | - Used for primitive values (number, boolean, null, undefined)<br>- Fixed size<br>- Fast access                |
| **Heap**    | - Used for reference types (objects, arrays, functions)<br>- Variable size<br>- Can grow/shrink during runtime |

---

### üîπ Why Are Objects/Arrays Stored in Heap?

* Their **size is not fixed**.
* They can **grow/shrink at runtime** (dynamically).
* Stack memory is not flexible for variable-sized data.

---

### üîπ What Does "Grow Dynamically" Mean?

> Adding or removing properties/elements **while the program is running**.

#### ‚úÖ Example 1: Object

```js
let person = { name: "Divyanshu" };

person.age = 24;        // grows (new property added)
delete person.name;     // shrinks (property removed)
```

#### ‚úÖ Example 2: Array

```js
let arr = [1, 2];
arr.push(3);   // grows
arr.pop();     // shrinks
```

---

### üîπ Is It Really Runtime?

Yes! Even if you **wrote the code statically**, JavaScript:

* Executes line-by-line during runtime.
* Allocates memory **when that line is reached**, not before.

#### Example:

```js
if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
  person.country = "India";  // added only *sometimes*
}
```

* Property added only if condition is true at runtime.

### üîπ Summary Table

| Type     | Stored In | Fixed Size? | Can Grow/Shrink?  | Example           |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Number   | Stack     | ‚úÖ           | ‚ùå                 | `let x = 5`       |
| Object   | Heap      | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ                 | `let obj = {}`    |
| Array    | Heap      | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ                 | `let arr = []`    |
| Function | Heap      | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ (closures etc.) | `function f() {}` |

Let me know if you want this as a downloadable PDF or a visual diagram of stack vs heap!


Absolutely! Let's go deeper with more **examples that clearly show how objects and arrays grow or shrink during runtime** in JavaScript ‚Äî not just because we wrote the code, but because it's actually happening as the program **executes**.

---

## üìò More Examples: Dynamic Growth/Shrinking at Runtime

---

### ‚úÖ Example 1: Based on `if` condition

```js
let person = {
  name: "Divyanshu"
};

let isAdult = true;

if (isAdult) {
  person.age = 24; // added only if condition is true
}

console.log(person);
```

* `person` object **grows** only if `isAdult` is true.
* If false, no `.age` property is added.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 2: Based on user input

```js
let user = {};
let key = prompt("Enter property name:");
let value = prompt("Enter property value:");

user[key] = value;

console.log(user);
```

* You don‚Äôt know the key or value beforehand.
* User can add any property ‚Üí **object structure is dynamic**.
* Grows in size as the user adds data.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 3: Array growing with `.push()` in loop

```js
let arr = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  arr.push(i);  // grows every iteration
}

console.log(arr);  // Output: [0, 1, 2]
```

* Array started empty.
* It **grew dynamically** inside the loop at runtime.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 4: Removing array elements dynamically

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

while (arr.length > 2) {
  arr.pop();  // shrinks during runtime
}

console.log(arr);  // Output: [1, 2]
```

* `.pop()` is reducing the array size at runtime.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 5: Object properties changing inside function

```js
let car = {
  brand: "Toyota"
};

function addColor(c) {
  c.color = "Red";  // dynamically added at runtime
}

addColor(car);
console.log(car);  // Output: { brand: 'Toyota', color: 'Red' }
```

* Property `.color` didn‚Äôt exist when the object was created.
* It was **added dynamically** during function execution.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 6: Deleting object properties at runtime

```js
let student = {
  name: "Ravi",
  age: 20,
  score: 85
};

delete student.age;     // removed dynamically
delete student["score"]; // another way

console.log(student);  // Output: { name: 'Ravi' }
```

* Object **shrinks** in size during execution.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 7: Adding properties conditionally in loops

```js
let obj = {};

for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  obj["key" + i] = i;  // Adds key1, key2, key3
}

console.log(obj); // Output: { key1: 1, key2: 2, key3: 3 }
```

* The number of properties is decided at **runtime**.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

These examples show how:

* Memory for objects/arrays is **not fixed at creation**.
* Properties and elements can be **added or removed anytime** during execution.
* That‚Äôs why they are **stored in the heap**, and that‚Äôs what **dynamic allocation** really means in JavaScript.
