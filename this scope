Q) let name = "hritik";
console.log("outer this is:", this);
this.naam = "divyanshu";
console.log("outer this is:", this);

const user = {
   name: "divyanshu",
   id: 765,
   greetings1: function(){
      console.log(`hello js user ${name}`);
      
   },
   greetings2: function(){
      console.log(`hello js user ${this.name}`);
      
   },
   printThis: function(){
      console.log(this);
      
   }
}

// console.log(user.greetings1());
// console.log(user.greetings2());
// console.log(user.printThis());

user.greetings1()
user.greetings2()
user.printThis()



now what i know is that when we are passing just username, so engine checks for name variable inside function scope, its not found, then engine searches inside object , now name key do exists inside object but its not treated as a variable, hence its not even found in  object scope so then engine finally  looks in gloal scope where it finaly finds the name variable.

Ans)  You're **very close** and your reasoning is almost spot on — just one small correction is needed to fully understand what’s happening.

Let’s dissect your current thought:

---

### 🟨 What You Said:

> "When we use just `name`, the engine checks for it inside the function scope. It's not found, so it checks inside the object."

### ❗ Correction:

🚫 JavaScript does **not** search **inside the object** for variables like `"name"` unless you explicitly use `this.name` or `object.name`.

---

## ✅ How JavaScript Resolves `name` (Step-by-step):

```js
const user = {
   name: "divyanshu",
   greetings1: function() {
      console.log(`hello js user ${name}`);
   }
};
```

Inside `greetings1()`, you're using `name` **without `this`**.

### Here's what JavaScript does when it sees `name`:

1. **Look inside the current function’s local scope** → ❌ not found
2. **Look in outer lexical scope (where the function was defined)**

   * In this case, `user.greetings1` was **defined inside the global scope**
   * ✅ Finds `let name = "hritik"` there
3. **It never searches inside the `user` object’s keys**

   * `"name": "divyanshu"` is a **property**, not a variable
   * So it's **invisible** unless you use `this.name` or `user.name`

---

## 🔁 So this is **very important to remember**:

> JavaScript’s **scope chain only works with variables declared using `let`, `const`, or `var`** — not object keys.

---

## 🧠 Think of it like this:

```js
const user = {
  name: "divyanshu",
  greet() {
    // does NOT see user.name unless you write this.name
    console.log(name); // looks for a variable
  }
};
```

* `name` here is treated like a **variable**, not an object key.
* Only `this.name` will access `"divyanshu"`.

---

## ✅ Final Output of Your Code (when uncommented):

```js
let name = "hritik";

user.greetings1(); // hello js user hritik
user.greetings2(); // hello js user divyanshu
user.printThis();  // logs user object
```

---

## 💡 Final Summary:

| Expression  | Meaning                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | Treated as variable, not object key     |
| `this.name` | Refers to key `"name"` on the object    |
| Object keys | Not part of variable scope              |
| Scope Chain | Only checks variable scopes, not object |

Let me know if you'd like a **visual diagram** of how scope resolution vs object property resolution works — it’s a super helpful mental model.



Q) JavaScript’s scope chain only works with variables declared using let, const, or var — not object keys.

so engine doesnt looks inside the object only because you cannot declare a variable inside an object, right?

Ans) Exactly — you’ve nailed the core idea! ✅

Let’s now **fully explain** why this is true and clarify **why object keys are not part of the scope chain.**

---

## 🔍 Statement:

> JavaScript’s scope chain only works with variables declared using `let`, `const`, or `var` — not object keys.

### ✅ Why?

Because:

> **You cannot declare a variable inside an object. You can only declare properties (keys).**

---

## 🧠 What’s the difference?

### 🔹 **Variable**

Declared using `let`, `const`, or `var` → goes into a **lexical scope**.

```js
function greet() {
  let name = "hritik";
  console.log(name); // ✅ found via scope chain
}
```

Here, `name` is a **real variable**, and JavaScript's **scope resolution engine** will track and resolve it.

---

### 🔸 **Object Property (key)**

Is just a key-value pair inside an object → **not a variable**.

```js
const obj = {
  name: "divyanshu"
};
```

Here, `"name"` is **not** a variable — it’s a **property** of `obj`.

To access it, you must use:

* `obj.name`
* or inside a method: `this.name`

But `name` on its own will not find this key.

---

## ✅ So yes — You're Right:

> **JS engine doesn't look inside the object** for a variable named `"name"` because:

1. Objects **don't have scoped variables** — they have **keys**.
2. The **scope chain only applies to variable environments**, not object structures.
3. Keys are **not part of the lexical environment record** that JS builds for resolving variables.

---

## 🔁 Visual Example:

```js
let name = "hritik";

const user = {
  name: "divyanshu",
  greet: function() {
    console.log(name);        // 🔍 Looks for variable → finds "hritik"
    console.log(this.name);   // ✅ Looks in object → finds "divyanshu"
  }
};
```

---

## 🧠 Mental Trick to Remember:

> **Scope chain = variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)**
>
> **Objects = data holders (keys)**
>
> ➤ They live in **two separate systems** — unless you connect them using `this`.
