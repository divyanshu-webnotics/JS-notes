to be completed by 15th november.

dsa roadmap:

focus on one question a day, to make you brain.exe work.

15 days array (easy level)
15 days strings (easy level)
15 days 2d array (easy level)
1 month recursion
1 month binary search


JS practical roadmap:

focus on dom manipulation till 15th october.
-to-do
-form-validation
-quiz-app
-expense-tracker
-add to cart page

then api call, promises and async await for next month.
-weather-api-app
-movie-api-app
-refactor-quiz-app-into-modular-components, that was week 7.


THEORY on WEEKEND:::::::::::

| **Oct 6 (Sun)**   | Async/Await, Microtasks vs Macrotasks                                                      |
| **Oct 12 (Sat)**  | DOM basics, Event delegation, Event bubbling vs capturing                                  |
| **Oct 13 (Sun)**  | PreventDefault vs StopPropagation, Browser Storage (localStorage vs sessionStorage)        |
| **Oct 19 (Sat)**  | Prototypes, Prototypal inheritance, Classes, Constructor functions                         |
| **Oct 20 (Sun)**  | Encapsulation, Private properties, Modules (import/export)                                 |

| **Oct 27 (Sun)**  | Default parameters, Error handling (try-catch-finally, custom errors)                      |
| **Nov 2 (Sat)**   | Debouncing vs Throttling concepts                                                          |
| **Nov 3 (Sun)**   | Memory leaks: causes & prevention strategies                                               |
| **Nov 9 (Sat)**   | Deep dive: Event loop execution (call stack, task queue, microtask queue)                  |
| **Nov 10 (Sun)**  | Quick overall revision of weak areas based on self-assessment                              |
| **Nov 15 (Fri)**  | Final revision & summarization of key concepts before interview                            |

ðŸ‘‰ This plan ensures consistent coverage of critical JS theory without overload. Youâ€™ll have time to digest each topic and revise effectively.
