📘 JavaScript: Constructor, this, and Prototype — Complete Notes
🔹 1. Constructor Functions
A constructor function is a regular function used to create objects.
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
When called with new, it creates a new object and assigns this to that object:
let p1 = new Person("Alice");
console.log(p1.name); // "Alice"
🔹 2. this in Constructor
Inside a constructor function, this refers to the newly created object.
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Here:
this.name = name adds a name property to the object being created.
So:
let p1 = new Person("Alice");
console.log(p1.name); // "Alice"
🔹 3. Adding Properties and Methods Inside Constructor
You can also add methods using this:
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.sayHi = function() {
    console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
  };
}
let p1 = new Person("Alice");
let p2 = new Person("Bob");

console.log(p1.sayHi === p2.sayHi); // ❌ false (new function created for each instance)
❗ Every time new Person() is called, a new function is created. This wastes memory.
🔹 4. The prototype Object
Each constructor function has a built-in prototype property.
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
};
Now all instances share the same sayHi function:
let p1 = new Person("Alice");
let p2 = new Person("Bob");

console.log(p1.sayHi === p2.sayHi); // ✅ true (same function)
✅ This is memory-efficient because sayHi is stored only once in memory and shared.
🔹 5. What is __proto__?
Every JavaScript object has a hidden property called __proto__ (or [[Prototype]] internally), which points to the constructor’s .prototype object.
let p1 = new Person("Alice");

console.log(p1.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // ✅ true
🧠 Prototype Chain Lookup
When you call p1.sayHi(), JavaScript:
Looks inside p1 for sayHi
Doesn’t find it
Goes to p1.__proto__ → which is Person.prototype
Finds it there → executes it
🔹 6. Diagram of Prototype Chain
p1 object:
{
  name: "Alice",
  __proto__ → Person.prototype {
                sayHi: function() { ... }
              }
}
🔹 7. What if You Remove this. in Constructor?
function Person() {
  skin_color = "brown"; // ❌ no "this"
}
🔥 Danger:
JavaScript puts skin_color in the global scope (in non-strict mode)
Or throws an error in "use strict" mode
✅ Correct usage:
function Person() {
  this.skin_color = "brown"; // ✅ stored in instance
}
🔹 8. What's Stored in Memory When You Call new Person()?
If your constructor is:
function Person() {
  this.skin_color = "brown";
  this.walking = function() {
    console.log("Walking...");
  };
}
Then:
let p1 = new Person();

Memory:
p1 → {
  skin_color: "brown",             ✅ stored directly
  walking: [function Walking...]   ❌ new copy (bad if repeated)
  __proto__ → Person.prototype     ✅ reference (not copy)
}
❗ Methods inside the constructor = separate copies per instance
✅ Methods on prototype = shared memory
🔹 9. Best Practice: Use Prototype for Methods
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name; // instance-specific
}

Person.prototype.walking = function() {
  console.log("Walking...");
};
Now all instances share walking() efficiently.
🔚 Final Summary Table
Concept
Description
this.property = value
Adds property directly to instance
this.method = function()
Creates new function for every instance ❌
Constructor.prototype.method = function()
Adds shared method for all instances ✅
__proto__
Internal link from object to constructor’s .prototype
Prototype chain
JS looks up methods through __proto__ when missing on object
Why not copy prototype?
To save memory — shared instead of duplicated

Great question, Divyanshu! Let's clarify this with a solid explanation:
🔍 Is prototype defined inside the constructor function?
👉 No, the prototype property is not defined inside the constructor function body.
It is a special property of the function itself, outside the constructor’s code.
Let’s break it down:
🔹 Every function in JavaScript (except arrow functions) has a .prototype property.
Here’s a simple constructor function:
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Even though you don’t write anything like this.prototype inside it, JavaScript automatically adds a Person.prototype object.
That prototype object is not part of the instance. It’s a special link between the constructor and the objects created from it.
🧠 Visual Understanding
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

console.log(Person.prototype); 
// 👉 This is defined by JS automatically
// 👉 It is an empty object initially: {}

// You can attach shared methods to it:
Person.prototype.sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
};
Now if you create an instance:
let p1 = new Person("Divyanshu");
p1.sayHi(); // "Hi, I'm Divyanshu"
Even though sayHi is not defined inside p1, it still works because:
p1.__proto__ === Person.prototype; // true
✅ Summary
Question
Answer
Is prototype defined inside constructor?
❌ No
Where is it defined?
On the constructor function itself, as a property
What's it used for?
Sharing methods/properties across all instances
Is it attached to the object (this) created?
❌ Not directly — but the object’s __proto__ points to it
